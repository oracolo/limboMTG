# LimboMTG

## A simple mtg bot for the [Limbo Slack bot](https://github.com/llimllib/limbo)

Nothing fancy; just a few functions that could prove useful while chatting about *Magic: The Gathering*.

Datas provided by the excellent [Deckbrew.com Magic: The Gathering API](https://deckbrew.com).

Individual functions may be tested by calling them by something like

    python -c "import mtg; print mtg.oracle("Serra Angel")'
